        <p class="lead text-muted">Christine Liang, at SIT, and Donna Peterson, a former Senior Waste Officer at WasteNet Southland, have collaborated to gather data on microplastics. This project has been built to include school children from Southland Enviroschools, ages ranging from primary, intermediate, and high school students. The Micro-Investigators are the school students who, as part of their education, are highlighting awareness of plastic pollution in local waterways and coastal areas. The project was recognised with an Environmental Action in Education Award at the 2021 Environment Southland Community Awards. </p>
