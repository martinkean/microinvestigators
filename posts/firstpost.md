Microplastics – tiny plastic particles that are smaller than 5 mm – have been found in the most remote places on Earth like Antarctica and Mt Everest. But even though you can’t see them, microplastics are closer to us than we think and can be found in our kai and local rivers.

Microinvestigators is a citizen science programme aiming to spread awareness of Microplastics in NZ rivers. Our goal is to make the invisible visible!
