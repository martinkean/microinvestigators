In 2019, Niamh Edginton (supervised by Dr Anna Palliser and Dr Claudia Gonnelli), investigated numbers of microplastics in two Invercargill waterways. She isolated and counted microplastics 1 – 5 mm in size. She found that 11 out of 16 samples showed a presence of microplastics (up to 25 particles).
The following year, in 2020, Cicy Zhang (supervised by Dr Christine Liang) used a USB digital microscope (1600X) and was able to identify even smaller particles (~1/10 mm in size) in samples from the same two Invercargill waterways that Niamh looked at. Using the USB microscope, Cicy also categorised her microplastics into the 4 F’s (foam, film, fibre, fragment) and different colours. She found up to 231 particles in a sample.
