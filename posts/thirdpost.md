The Microinvestigators project was chosen as one of three pilot projects across Te Pūkenga - New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology (NZIST) organisations, to receive concentrated support from the Research Directors, towards gaining external funding. We have now secured funding from the Lottery Environment and Heritage grant to deliver the Microinvestigators citizen science programme across Southland and to explore expanding it nationally.
